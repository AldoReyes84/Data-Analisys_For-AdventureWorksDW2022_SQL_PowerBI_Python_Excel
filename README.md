Which are:

## [Power BI Data Analysis](https://github.com/AldoReyes84/Power_BI_AdventureWorks2022_Data_Analysis)

## [Excel Data Analysis connect to SQL Server](https://github.com/AldoReyes84/Excel_SQL_Server_AdventureWorks_Data_Analysis)

In all cases, we have the same information, 

Even though the Sales Quantity has increased in the last year,

Which leads to negative Margins

We will take a deeper dive into products and resellers to see which products are bringing the most negative margins.

This is something a company normally wouldn't stand for unless it's part of a strategic plan to improve presence or expand market share.

Nevertheless, this company also has an internet sales channel that could be subsidizing the resellers, so that these margin losses may have gone unnoticed.

So we'll also take a look at the internet sales.
