# Data Analisys For AdventureWorksDW2022 

This project presents a complete data analysis workflow using the AdventureWorksDW2022 database across four platforms:

## FactResellersSales table

All platforms analyze the same dataset and produce consistent results.

Despite an increase in **Sales Quantity** over the last year:

And a corresponding rise in **Sales Amount**:

The same goes for the **Product Cost**.

Which leads to negative **Margins**

This margin reduction correlates with a notable rise in **Discount** levels throughout 2013

We will take a deeper dive into **Products** and **Resellers** to see which products are bringing the most negative margins.

**Insight:** Such **margin erosion** is typically unsustainable unless part of a **strategic initiative** such as **increasing market presence** or **expanding customer base**.

Additionally, the **company** operates an **Internet Sales** channel, which may be **subsidizing reseller losses**. This possibility will be explored in the next phase of the analysis
